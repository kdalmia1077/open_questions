The tertiary random forest here is a collection of regression trees. The output of the forest is mean of outcomes of each tree.

The structure of each tree is as follows

NUM_PREDICTORS <number_of_predictors>    // number of predictors
TREESTART <index_of_the_tree>		 // Signifies start of a new tree.
TREELINE  <index_of_1st_child>  <index_of_2nd_child>  <index_of_3rd_child>  <index_of_predictor_used_at_this_node>  <Value_1>  <Value_2>  <Y/N>  <Prediction>
TREELINE ...
TREELINE ...

A tree in the model file starts with the tag 'TREESTART' followed by the index of this tree.
It is followed by tree lines, each of them corresponding to a node in the tree.
Each tree line starts with the tag 'TREELINE'. At each non-terminal node in the tree
there are three candidate nodes to go to. If the value of the predictor is less than 'Value_1', 
then we move to the 1st child of this node, else if the value of the predictor is greater than equal to 'Value_1'
and less than equal to 'Value_2' then we go to 2nd child, else we go to the 3rd node.
i.e: { < Value_1 } { >= Value_1 && <= Value_2 } { > Value_2 }
Note that Value_1 will be always strictly less than Value_2 in every valid tree.
The indices of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd child are given in 2nd,3rd,4th column of the treeline corresponding to each non-terminal node.
For terminal nodes 2nd, 3rd, 4th colums are '-1'.
The 5th column is the index of the predictor to be used for evaluating the above conditions.
The 6th, 7th columns are 'Value_1' and 'Value_2' respectively.
The 8th is a flag which is 'Y' if the node is a terminal node and 'N' if node is a non-terminal node.
The last column is the prediction value at this node. For our purpose this is meaningful only for terminal nodes.

Notes:
The i'th "TREELINE" line refers to node labeled (i-1). For instance the first "TREELINE" refers to the root which is Node0.
